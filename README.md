# Sales Performance Dashboard: Predictive Sales Trend Analysis & Opportunity Identification

## Overview

This project develops a sales performance dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of current sales data and incorporates predictive analytics to forecast future trends and identify high-potential sales opportunities.  The analysis leverages historical sales data to build predictive models, allowing for proactive intervention and strategic decision-making.  The dashboard presents key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations to facilitate a clear understanding of sales performance and potential areas for improvement.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (for predictive modeling - specify the specific models used if applicable, e.g., `LinearRegression`, `ARIMA`)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the script:** Execute the main script using `python main.py`

## Example Output

The script will print a summary of the key findings to the console, including:

* Overall sales trends and predictions.
* Identification of top-performing and underperforming products/regions.
* Predicted sales figures for a specified future period.

Additionally, the script will generate the following visualization files in the project directory:

* `sales_trend.png`: A line chart visualizing historical and predicted sales trends.
* `<other_plot_names>.png`: (Add any other plot names generated by the script)
